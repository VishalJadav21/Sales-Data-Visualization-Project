# Sales Data Visualization Project

A Python project for analyzing and visualizing sample sales data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This script loads sales data, performs basic exploration, and generates visualizations for sales per product line and sales trends over time.

## Project Structure

- `sales_visualizer.py`: The main Python script for data loading, analysis, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required for this project.
- `sales_data_sample.csv`: The sample sales dataset (sourced separately, e.g., from Kaggle). *(Note: This file is not included in this repository if you are using a public dataset and respecting its distribution terms. If you've included it, you can remove this note).*
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you are working from GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have the `sales_data_sample.csv` file in the project directory.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure the `sales_data_sample.csv` file is in the same directory as `sales_visualizer.py`.**
    The script currently expects the file at: `C:\Users\VISHAL JADAV\OneDrive\Desktop\Projects\Resume Detection\sales_data_sample.csv`. You might need to adjust the `file_path` variable in `sales_visualizer.py` if your file is located elsewhere or if you move the project.

2.  **Execute the script:**
    ```bash
    python sales_visualizer.py
    ```
    This will print data summaries to the console and display the generated plots.

## Visualizations Included

-   Total Sales per Product Line (Bar Chart)
-   Total Sales Over Time (Monthly Line Chart)

## Future Enhancements (Examples)

-   Add more visualizations (e.g., sales by region, customer segmentation).
-   Implement more advanced data cleaning and preprocessing.
-   Develop interactive dashboards (e.g., using Dash or Streamlit).
-   Add functionality to save plots to files.
